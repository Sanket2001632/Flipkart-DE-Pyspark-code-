# Flipkart-DE-Pyspark-code


## Overview

The Flipkart-DE-PySpark project is designed to leverage Apache Spark's powerful distributed data processing capabilities for analyzing large datasets related to e-commerce transactions, user behavior, and product performance on Flipkart. This project aims to provide insights that can help improve customer experience and optimize business operations.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Efficiently read data from various sources, including CSV, JSON, and databases.
- **Data Processing**: Utilize PySpark for data transformation, cleaning, and aggregation.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to present insights in a comprehensible format.
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets seamlessly with Spark's distributed computing capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing.
- **PySpark**: Python API for Spark.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis.
